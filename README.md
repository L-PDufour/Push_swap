# Push_swap

Début 14 avril 2023

Write a program in C called push_swap which calculates and displays
on the standard output the smallest program, made of Push swap language instructions,
that sorts the integers received as arguments.

Sorting values is simple. To sort them the fastest way possible is less simple. Especially
because from one integers configuration to another, the most efficient sorting solution can
differ.

Makefile, libft :
     - If the subject requires it, you must submit a Makefile which will compile your
     source files to the required output with the flags -Wall, -Wextra and -Werror, use
     cc, and your Makefile must not relink.
     - Your Makefile must at least contain the rules $(NAME), all, clean, fclean and
     re.
     - If your project allows you to use your libft, you must copy its sources and its
     associated Makefile in a libft folder with its associated Makefile. Your project’s
     Makefile must compile the library by using its Makefile, then compile the project.

-You have to write a program named push_swap that takes as an argument the stack
a formatted as a list of integers. The first argument should be at the top of the
stack (be careful about the order)
